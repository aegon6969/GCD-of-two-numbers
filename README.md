# Find the GCD of two numbers

## AIM:
To write a program to find the GCD of two numbers using function.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
### Step1: Define a function.
### Step2: Get the two numbers from the user.
### Step3: Compare the two values, to find the smaller number.
### Step4: Use for() and if() loop to find the GCD of the two numbers.

## Program:
```

Program to find the gcd of two number using function.
Developed by: M.Rishi
RegisterNumber:  22000276

n1=int(input())
n2=int(input())
def gcd():
    if n1>n2:
        smaller=n2
    else:
        smaller=n1
    for i in range(1, smaller+1):
        if((n1 % i == 0) and (n2 % i == 0)):
            gcd1=i
    print("GCD of two numbers is:",gcd1) 

```

## Output:
![gcd of two number](/gcp1.png)


## Result:
Thus the program to find the GCD of two numbers is written and verified using python programming.
